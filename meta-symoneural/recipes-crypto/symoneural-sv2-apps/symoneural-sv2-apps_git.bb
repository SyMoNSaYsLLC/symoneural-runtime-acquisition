# Recipe created by recipetool

# WARNING: the following LICENSE and LIC_FILES_CHKSUM values are best guesses - it is
# your responsibility to verify that the values are complete and correct.

# The following license files were not able to be identified and are
# represented as "Unknown" below, you will need to check them yourself:
#   LICENSE.md
#
# NOTE: multiple licenses have been detected; they have been separated with &
# in the LICENSE value for now since it is a reasonable assumption that all
# of the licenses apply. If instead there is a choice between the multiple
# licenses then you should change the value to separate the licenses with |
# instead of &. If there is any doubt, check the accompanying documentation
# to determine which situation is applicable.
# LICENSE established from the licence text in the acquired tree. recipetool had
# emitted a non-SPDX token ('Unknown'/'Apache'), which newer OE-Core's SPDX parser
# rejects outright: do_populate_lic dies with
# "AttributeError: 'UnknownId' object has no attribute 'name'".
# Built by symoneural-pristine: a DISPOSABLE `git archive` export of the
# acquired tree. ${S} is throwaway; the acquired tree is never written to.
# do_unpack asserts the tree HEAD equals SRCREV and refuses to build otherwise.
