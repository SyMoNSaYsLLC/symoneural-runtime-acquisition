# LICENSE established from the licence text in the acquired tree. recipetool had
# emitted a non-SPDX token ('Unknown'/'Apache'), which newer OE-Core's SPDX parser
# rejects outright: do_populate_lic dies with
# "AttributeError: 'UnknownId' object has no attribute 'name'".
# Built by symoneural-pristine: a DISPOSABLE `git archive` export of the
# acquired tree. ${S} is throwaway; the acquired tree is never written to.
# do_unpack asserts the tree HEAD equals SRCREV and refuses to build otherwise.

# <pkg>_1.0+git-r0, and symoneural-pristine exports it as the wheel version

# died with IndexError on int(parts[index]).

# recipetool emitted empty do_configure/do_compile/do_install stubs ALONGSIDE
# a real build-class inherit. A recipe-level function OVERRIDES the inherited
# one, so the stubs silently won: this recipe installed nothing (or ran bare
# `make`) despite inheriting a working class. Stubs removed so the inherited
# class actually runs.
